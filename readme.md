How do you view the tables in the db? I know cli present but always does it make sense?
The UIs or the db viewer present just suck.
I like the outerbase. So thought of recreating it in my own way.
Plus I am learning php and svelte. So thought of doing it in this way.

Initial support -> mysql + pg + sqlite + mongodb + redis
* Using svelte 3/4 cause thats what mostly getting used in my workplace(appwrite)
* No runes
